# This project consist of Robot Framework Json libraries and few other libraries which enables to test APIs 
in a professional manner.
In order to be able to run the test suite you need to have robot framework and the dependancies installed and configured.
Please also note the directories stracture if not managed might result in to error.
Extensive documentation is provided to understand each test case and validation points.
*needed basic python expertise to understand custom functions and looping.

**Highlights**
1: A sample Templated Data driven example is shown to match lenthy test data in a repetative manner
2: A keyword & loop driven approacgh is shown alternatievely to catter to diffrent automation needs.

I strongly sugest to also look at my https://github.com/SubrataMishra/API_NEWMAN_DOCKER postman and Docker compose public repo which can be neatly used for API automation & data driven tests. 
Also there is also a Dockerhub repo can be used to pull pre defined images to run crossplateform tests without installing any testing tool on local machine Please look at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/subrat1982/newman-postman or just use dockerpull subrat1982/newman-postman ....
also see my other container driven work & robotframework containers on my docker hub https://hub.docker.com/u/subrat1982.
